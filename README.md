# Generate an image from a reference using a Genetic Algorithm

This project was mainly the occasion to start using React. To do, I thought what kind of fun things I may do with it.
This reflexion took me one more time on Genetic Algorithm and I wondered if it was possible to rebuild an image from another one.
 
As usual, I tried to make the project severless so I could take advantage of Github Pages to make the result easily available.
